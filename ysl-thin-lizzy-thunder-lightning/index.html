<p><strong>You Should Listen</strong> is a thing where I post about some music that I'm (probably) listening to that I think would be great if we got together and listened to together. I'm not going to tell you where to find it or anything, but I might provide a track off youtube if I can find it. </p>
<p>Additionally, I make no promises to actually writing anything about these suggestions other than to just suggest them.</p>
<p>With that out of the way...</p>
<p>Just imagine it now... I call you up on the telephone, hoping either you or one of your parents picks up and not your jerk older sibling that thinks we're nerds. &quot;Hey, want to come over and listen to some Thin Lizzy?&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe you're tired of sitting around at home. Maybe you were just looking for an excuse to hang out and play some <em>Sword of Fargoal</em> on the C64.</p>
<p>But, maybe you're genuinely are interested to hear what I meant when you heard the garbled words &quot;Thin Lizzy's new LP&quot; come through the corded phone hanging off the wall in your parent's kitchen. You hop on your bike and pedal down to my end of the neighborhood.</p>

<h2 id="lynott-s-unintended-farewell">Lynott's Unintended Farewell</h2>
<p>I don't mean to go too far into history on these but here we are.</p>
<p>This is Thin Lizzy's twelfth and final LP. They would go on a tour to support this album, but break up shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>If you know anything of Thin Lizzy, you might recognize the name <em>Phil Lynott</em>. The principal songwriter, vocalist, and bassist of the band, he would unfortunately pass away from drug-related issues 3 years after the release of this album in 1986.</p>
<p>In my opinion, his abilities and this band in general are criminally underrated in the 70s-80s hard rock genre.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-catch-you">What Will Catch You</h2>
<p>If you listen to just the &quot;top track&quot; off this album (according to Apple Music, anyway), you'll listen to <em>Cold Sweat</em>.</p>
<p>Here's a video that you probably need to open in a youtube tab: </p>

    </iframe>
</div>
<p><em>Cold Sweat</em> is bad ass. It's only 3:07 long, so in the time it would take me to type out anything to tell you why, you could just decide on your own.</p>
<p>The opening guitar riff is catchy enough, but really, you're going to get about 1:25 into the song and be overrun by some masterful shredding that will continue through the rest of the track.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-keep-you-coming-back">What Will Keep You Coming Back</h2>
<p>Thin Lizzy puts together an effort that includes everything from straight up ass-kicking guitar expositions like <em>Someday She Is Going to Hit Back</em>, sweeping soundscapes as heard in <em>The Sun Goes Down</em>, and even hit you with the classic Thin Lizzy feels (in my estimation) with <em>Bad Habits</em> or <em>Heart Attack</em>. </p>
<p>Songs like <em>The Holy War</em> and <em>This is the One</em> have some deeper lyrical content, and I always enjoy the introspection that this type of story sparks.</p>
<p>Rhythmically, there's some cool stuff beyond the normal 4/4 feels to be found here, too. Check out <em>The Holy War</em>, if you didn't.</p>
<h2 id="my-favorite-tracks">My Favorite Tracks</h2>
<p>The whole thing is great, but I'll try to stick with 3 favorites.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Holy War</li>
<li>Cold Sweat</li>
<li>Baby Please Don't Go</li>
</ul>
