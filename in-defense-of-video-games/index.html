<p>I was having a friendly discussion with a friend a few weeks ago, and during our chat something came up about using one's time to be productive or to simply &quot;consume.&quot;</p>
<p>The breadth of different activities that could be considered productive or not was fairly vast, as is typical in this type of exchange, and generally we agreed. However, eventually it landed on video games.</p>
<p>I forget the exact words, and truthfully it doesn't matter too much; I know that no harm was meant in the statement. Still, I ended up considering the thesis:</p>
<p><strong>Video games are a waste of time. The act of playing (or consuming) video game material does not <em>produce</em>, and therefore is not productive.</strong></p>
<p>I disagreed.</p>
<p id="zola-continue-reading"><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>Understand before moving on, my experiences are by definition anecdotal. The way I feel about how certain factors and experiences shaped my life are up for interpretation, but the best judge I have, I figure, is myself. </p>
<p>Additionally, while I made sort of a half-assed promise to myself that I wouldn't divulge into my personal life much in this blog adventure, but some backstory is probably necessary. </p>
<p>I'm a 90s kid. I was a young child when I recieved a slightly used Sega GameGear for a birthday gift. It came with a handful of games, the only games I would ever get to play with it. I still own it today. I was a bit older, but not that much older, when I was gifted a Sega Genesis. Three years or so from there, I would come into possession of the Nintendo 64. In the midst of all these home game consoles, I also had access to a <em>no good, very bad, desktop computer with no internet connection</em>.</p>
<h2 id="an-educational-perspective">An Educational Perspective</h2>
<p>You won't find me arguing that the primary purpose of playing games is to have fun. Part of what we all find so great about increasingly advanced virtual settings is the ability to substitute the current reality for a fictional one, a reality where the rules we've learned here on Earth need not necessarily apply. </p>
<p>But this doesn't mean you can't pick up things in the game that can't be translated back to real life.</p>
<p>You might think I'm going to rant at length about how great my hand-eye coordination is, or maybe my superior reflexes. I think that even if there is evidence to prove that, it's sort of a shallow argument for the initial thesis. I want to provide detail that demonstrates something tangible was <em>produced</em> from my video game intake. So, I'm taking a different approach.</p>
<h3 id="boost-your-stats-vocab-1">Boost Your Stats, Vocab +1</h3>
<p>As a child, like any other, I endured the slog of vocabulary, spelling, and reading comprehension. Many of the video games I played in the early-mid 90s were still sometimes subjected to absolutely <em>fascinating</em> translations due to localization between Japan and western countries not being fully fledged out. </p>
<p>Often times, this led to overly complicated or somewhat confusing dialogue. In one particularly well known case (which didn't apply to me), the translation for <em>Ocarina of Time</em> in Spanish was simply sent along with a guide for translating the English words present in the game to spanish. Perhaps they should have marketed it as a way to learn English?</p>
<p>On topic, there were quite a few games that pushed the boundaries of what a child would (should?) know at a given age. In school I learned these types of words had a dollar amount associated, usually $10, $100, or the coveted <em>million</em>.</p>
<p>I have a few examples of text from the game <em>Dragon Warrior III</em>, of which I was in the 4th grade when I started playing. </p>
<p><img src="/images/dq3sticker.png" alt="" 
width="275" style="float: left;"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rumor has it that you can go from the cave on the <strong>promontory</strong> to the Tower of Najima.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you walk along the ocean from the castle youâ€™ll come to a cave on the <strong>promontory</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you know what a promontory was when you were in elementary school? Could you describe it now? I didn't, but the context clues and my curiosity led to me a dictionary. I not only learned the word and how to use it, but also how to spell it.</p>
<h3 id="music-a-universal-language-until-you-try-to-understand-it">Music, A Universal Language - Until You Try To Understand It</h3>
<p>Let's take one look at Ocarina of Time, as well. Just the names of the songs you learn:
<img src="/images/linkocarina.jpg" alt="" 
width="150" style="float: right;"/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minuet</strong> of Forest</li>
<li><strong>Bolero</strong> of Fire</li>
<li><strong>Serenade</strong> of Water</li>
<li><strong>Requiem</strong> of Spirit</li>
<li><strong>Nocturne</strong> of Shadow</li>
<li><strong>Prelude</strong> of Light</li>
</ul>
<p>At that level, all these words could be boiled down as adjectives of the word &quot;song,&quot; probably. This one facet of the game alone increased my operating vocabulary by a multiple of 6, but enough of that.</p>
<p>For brevity, let's use a single example. When you read the word &quot;minuet,&quot; can you feel the time signature in your head? What if you had a base understanding of various musical styles before you started &quot;officially&quot; learning music in middle school or high school?</p>
<p>I don't want to skip this here, I can't stress enough that the awesome soundtracks I listened to for hours on end while I played these games (or even just sat in the options menu to listen to the songs... seriously.) contibuted heavily to a future passion in music.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-did-it-end-up-producing">So, what did it end up <em>producing</em>?</h3>
<p>I did not read many books as a child, believe it or not. I do not read many books to this day. </p>
<p>I did spend a lot of time on the computer or video game console. By the 5th grade, I was able to boast college level skills in reading comprehension. I developed a passion for music that has thankfully turned into a lifelong thing for me now.</p>
<p>All this pontificating might make it seem I'm advocating that video games assist in childhood learning development. The anectodal evidence I've provided proves almost nothing - each person is different and learns at their own pace. Still, I'm confident my path gave me a boost in my education. </p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Would I suggest I know what's best for a child? <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Am I saying playing video games as a child increased my vocabulary, not to mention my understanding of other various topics? <strong>Yes.</strong></p>
<h2 id="are-shared-experiences-a-waste-of-time">Are Shared Experiences a Waste of Time?</h2>
<p>This part's going to sound sentimental. I don't want it to be, but hey. </p>
<p>A few things often get overlooked when talking about what can be produced. As far as what value something has, that belongs to the beholder. It could be that the only thing worth value has a dollar amount attached. I don't believe that's true.
I personally think that friendships and memories are valid in this realm.</p>
<p>Playing games with friends was a great way to spend time. I didn't understand at the time that I would be creating memories with these people that we still talk about <em>over 15 years later</em>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-to-know-someone">Getting to Know Someone</h3>
<p>Ever go to a friends house, and maybe they want to play some cooperative game, you've played it before - used to play it for hours on end with your sibling.</p>
<p>Maybe it's <em>Halo</em> or something, heck I dunno what the kids play these days. In my time it was <em>Streets of Rage</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, you start playing and something is off. This person isn't playing like your usual partner would. They're human after all, and humans are unique. Well, give it enough time and you'll start to learn their patterns, adjust to their style of gameplay.</p>
<p>Isn't that weird? Maybe it isn't if you've encountered this phenomenon as well.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, of course, I love to play some games with my brother when I can. It sounds strange, but with actual decades of cooperative tactics with him as my designated P2, I know what he's going to do and he knows what I'm going to do... in nearly any game we play.</p>
<img src="/images/zanBolo.png" alt="Family Pic, Flying over Valley of the Four Winds, circa 2013" style="float: left;"/>
<p><em>Family Pic, Flying over Valley of the Four Winds, late 2012</em></p>
<h3 id="ephemeral-worlds-permanent-memories">Ephemeral Worlds, Permanent Memories</h3>
<p>Even in a digital world where we can all meet up for some adventures, worlds that will no doubt eventually disappear into the great digital void, permanent memories and bonds can be produced.</p>
<p>I won't forget my cousin, down on his luck after trying to fight an enemy his superior, trying to collect chicken feathers in <em>Runescape</em> to buy back his lost armor. We still laugh about it to this day.</p>
<p>My friends will never forget the horrors of our first run through <em>Gnomeregan</em> in <em>World of Warcraft</em>. There is a running joke amongst my circle of friends who played to this day about the absolute disaster of a night that was.</p>
<p>Nothing of real value was produced in the world, perhaps, to one who only views the result of &quot;production&quot; as something tangible to all, and not a few. </p>
<p>I maintain that even though these old games will eventually disappear, the experiences we shared playing them will probably last a lifetime.</p>
<h2 id="the-tinkerer">The Tinkerer</h2>
<p>I have one last statement in defense of video games being a producer for myself. I'll fill in a bit of my &quot;tech origin story&quot; or whatever terrible thing they call it when you start down the road of computer aptitude, dooming yourself to a life behind a keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="rollercoaster-tycoon">Rollercoaster Tycoon</h3>
<p>It was a sad day when my new Rollercoaster Tycoon game from the book fair wouldn't load due to my PC not meeting requirements. I didn't want to tell my parents that it didn't work after begging them to buy it for me, and I didn't have any internet access at the time, so I started digging around.</p>
<p>I started opening files, looking at everything the computer could tell me about my Rollercoaster Tycoon installation. </p>
<p>It took me some time, but I found the init config. Magical, I know.</p>
<p>Long story short, I changed the default values for the requirements. The game ran perfectly fine, I discovered years later due to my fascination with the game, just in general but also because I spent so much time trying to get it to work, that it was written primarily by one man (Chris Sawyer) in assembly. </p>
<h3 id="other-games">Other games</h3>
<p>Sometime I'll go into other games that inspired me as well, I don't know if it counts as &quot;producing&quot; however, but I looked up to some of these devs <em>through their games</em>. It made me want to do something similar. </p>
<p>Maybe it didn't produce something the days I was playing the games, but fair to say long term it definitely instilled thoughts into my head about what I'd like to do when I grow up. (Actually a lie, I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up)</p>
<h2 id="the-final-credits">The Final Credits</h2>
<p>I don't think anyone needs to agree with what I've said. Video games can still be a colossal waste of time. Personally, I've found they produced at least some benefits.</p>
<p>I daresay though, without a crystal ball to see the future, can we really determine if any time spent in the present is wasted?</p>
