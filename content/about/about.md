### Hello, my name is Lydell. 

This is where most personal sites tell you they are **X** titled software engineer working at amazing company **Y** to make **Z** a better thing for the world.


Instead, I'm going to muse about a few select topics in markdown. If you've found yourself here, welcome.


You can find me online as [@dangerous_l](https://twitter.com/dangerous_l)
