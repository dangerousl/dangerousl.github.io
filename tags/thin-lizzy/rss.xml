                <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;this-is-the-one&quot;&gt;This Is The One&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Should Listen&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is a thing where I post about some music that I&#x27;m (probably) listening to that I think would be great if we got together and listened to together. I&#x27;m not going to tell you where to find it or anything, but I might provide a track off youtube if I can find it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I make no promises to actually writing anything about these suggestions other than to just suggest them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine it now... I call you up on the telephone, hoping either you or one of your parents picks up and not your jerk older sibling that thinks we&#x27;re nerds. &amp;quot;Hey, want to come over and listen to some Thin Lizzy?&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&#x27;re tired of sitting around at home. Maybe you were just looking for an excuse to hang out and play some &lt;em&gt;Sword of Fargoal&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; on the C64.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, maybe you&#x27;re genuinely are interested to hear what I meant when you heard the garbled words &amp;quot;Thin Lizzy&#x27;s new LP&amp;quot; come through the corded phone hanging off the wall in your parent&#x27;s kitchen. You hop on your bike and pedal down to my end of the neighborhood.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
