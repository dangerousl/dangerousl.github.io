&lt;p&gt;I was having a friendly discussion with a friend a few weeks ago, and during our chat something came up about using one&#x27;s time to be productive or to simply &amp;quot;consume.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breadth of different activities that could be considered productive or not was fairly vast, as is typical in this type of exchange, and generally we agreed. However, eventually it landed on video games.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forget the exact words, and truthfully it doesn&#x27;t matter too much; I know that no harm was meant in the statement. Still, I ended up considering the thesis:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video games are a waste of time. The act of playing (or consuming) video game material does not &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and therefore is not productive.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagreed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
